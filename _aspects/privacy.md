There are a few mailing lists and issues which should be kept private. This includes certain legal or fiscal issues, and includes (often) nominations and votes on individuals to grant them new access levels. Keeping nominations on private lists ensures that if the nomination fails, you need not be embarassed. Note that different projects have different norms around nominations, so be sure to check with your specific project first.
